Jenkins is the #1 Continuous Integration and Delivery server. Kohsuke Kawaguchi, one of the founders of CloudBees, created it in 2006 as the "Hudson" project. In 2011, the project was renamed to Jenkins.

Jenkins is maintained and supported by an independent and active community (https://www.jenkins.io) that welcomes new contributors of all technical and experience levels. The Jenkins Code of Conduct is enforced to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. We discuss ways that you can get involved at the end of this class.

CloudBees partners with the Jenkins community for development and maintenance tasks. CloudBees engineers contribute significantly to the Jenkins project, coordinate with the community on releases, and contribute fixes back to the community.

CloudBees publishes monthly newsletters for the Jenkins community, organizes DevOps World, and supports numerous other Jenkins events.
