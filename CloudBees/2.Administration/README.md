### Sections
1. **Installation and upgrades**

    How to install, set up, and upgrade Jenkins.  Familiarize yourself with your lab environment that is used for labs in this class.  Self-study students set up their local lab environments

    _Estimated time: 30 minutes plus 30-60 minutes for lab installation_

2. **Using "Manage Jenkins"**

   Familiarize yourself with the Manage Jenkins screens that are used to accomplish many basic administrative tasks.
    
   _Estimated time: 1 hour_
  
3. **Manage plugins**

   _Estimated time: 30 minutes_

4. **Build notifications**

   How to configure notifications for builds on the dashboard. The content of the notifications is defined in the Pipelines.

   _Estimated time: 15 minutes_

5. **Working with nodes and agents**

    Understand the components used to run Jenkins as a distributed build architecture, where masters and agents run on different nodes. Also, learn how to create and monitor the nodes where agents execute and understand the different patterns used to define agents.
  
    _Estimated time: 1 to 1-1/2 hour_

6. **Security**

    Learn about administrative tasks and practices that keep your Jenkins installation secure. This includes authentication, authorization, and accounting. as well as setting the global security settings that implement security protections that are built into Jenkins and using credentials to get trusted access to internal and external resources.

    _Estimated time:  1 to 1-1/2 hours_

7. **Folders**

    Learn how to use folders to segregate builds by project and team.

    _Estimated time: 1 hour_

8. **Monitoring**

    Learn about the tools available to monitor builds that run on your Jenkins instance.

    _Estimated time: 15 minutes_

9. **Backups**

    Learn how to back up your Jenkins instance and what should be backed up when.

    _Estimated time: 30 minutes_

10. **Automating tasks with CLI**

    Learn how to use the Jenkins CLI and Jenkins API command line tools. Using these tools allows you to write scripts to do tasks that would otherwise be done through the UI.

    _Estimated time: 30 minutes to 1 hour_
